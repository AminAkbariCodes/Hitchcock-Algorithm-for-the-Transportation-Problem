# 228A-Final Project

This is a short description of my project.

## Requirements

- Python 3.11
- NumPy
- Tkinter
- Pygame
- PIL

## Installation

1. Clone this repository: `git clone https://github.com/AminAkbariCodes/228A-Final_Project.git`
2. Navigate to the project directory: `cd 228A-Final_Project`
3. Install the required packages: `pip install -r requirements.txt` (You need to create this file listing the packages)
4. Run the script: `python 228A-Final_Project.py`

## Running the Executable

If you want to run the precompiled executables, you can find them in the `dist` directory. There are two executables: one for 64-bit Windows systems (`228A-Final_Project_64.exe`) and one for 32-bit systems (`228A-Final_Project_32.exe`). Link: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1fJ5sy59gFJrIZ_VTA0XfjuvOi-ROtLhT?usp=sharing

To run the 64-bit executable, for example, you would run: `dist/228A-Final_Project_64.exe`.

Note: You'll need to have the images in the same directory as the executable.
