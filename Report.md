# Hitchcock Algorithm for the Transportation Problem

The transportation problem, a type of network flow problem, is a classic optimization problem that originates from the field of operations research. It involves finding the most cost-effective way of transporting goods from factories (supply nodes) to customers (demand nodes). The challenge lies in determining the quantity of goods to be transported from each factory to each customer such that the total transportation cost is minimized and the supply and demand constraints at each node are satisfied.

One of the most widely used methods for solving transportation problems is the Hitchcock Transportation Algorithm, also known as the stepping-stone method or the MODI (Modified Distribution) method. The algorithm follows a series of steps to reach the optimal solution: starting from an initial feasible solution, it iteratively improves the solution until no further improvements can be made.

In this project, we've implemented the Hitchcock Transportation Algorithm in a Python application. We aimed to design an efficient, user-friendly tool that can take in supply and demand data, perform the necessary calculations, and visually represent the steps and results of the algorithm. We hope that this tool can serve as a valuable resource for understanding and applying the Hitchcock Transportation Algorithm.

To use the tool, download the provided executable file and follow the instructions in the user manual.

(Note: The executable file is designed for Windows 64-bit systems. If you require a 32-bit version, please contact us.)
